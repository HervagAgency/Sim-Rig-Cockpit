# DIY Aluminium Profile Sim Rig

By examining tons of pictures, shared plans, and consumer sim rig manuals I decided to make my attempt to design my own aluminum profile cockpit.

## Features

- Install every simracing hardware
- Customizable
- Compact size
- Affordable (much cheaper than production ones)

This is a slight combination of **Sim Lab GT1 EVO** and **P1-X** sim racing cockpits with some additions to replace fabricated pedal plates and wheel and shifter mounts.
The main point was to create a reasonable affordable and compact plan but rigid and symmetric.
It's all built with 40 mm anodized aluminum extrusion also known as 8020 and applies for mounting wheelbase, pedals in a rotated position, h-shifter, handbrake, monitor, and possible sequential shifter.

So for the base, I took a 40x80 profile with 1200mm length besides 1350mm using in Sim Lab's cockpits. It better suits my height and room place cause I don't need any additional adjustment range in my pedals and for the tallest driver better to push back seat. The wheelbase podium made again with a 40x80 profile it is quite enough even for direct drive wheels with an appropriate amount of torque, the two 40x40 bars made for setting wheel position.
The side frame for shifter and handbrake copies P1-X height and length and can be easily inverted for right-hand drivers. The additional 200 mm stripes use for adjusting and rotating shifter and handbrake to meet driver ergonomics.
For pedal plate created a square frame with 40x40 profiles supporting gt- and formula-style mounting solution with two height columns borrowed from GT1 Evo cockpit to adjust pedals angle and height. Right now I have T3PA pedals inverted like in a real road car (GT style) and I tried it to set like formula one and it fits perfectly while setting the right angle. 
Also, I like when the monitor is placed as close as possible to the wheel to form an immersive field of view, like a see and touch the real wheel but the dash and windshield of the car rendered in a game. So I integrated the monitor stand, was afraid that it can wobble with strong force feedback but nothing serious. The stand consists of two 40x40 profiles long and two crossbars adjustable for every VESA mount, didn't calculate max load but my 32-inch ultrawide monitor sits rock solid.
At the bottom of the rig installed four adjustable feet for leveling the whole construction and protecting the floor from scratches.

**In general**, I made a light and shorten copy of **P1-X** using 40x80 (instead of 40x160) with pedals adjustment from **GT1 EVO** in combination with a monitor stand.
My seat is a replica BRIDE VIOS series with L-brackets but I believe you can easily install any seat from a road car.
